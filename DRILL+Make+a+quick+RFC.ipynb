    "#### 3. A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report."

    "Give enough time/ a month to gather the information from each group with a polite reminder so that the survey is completed on time. If we receive less than 50% back then extend the deadline with a reminde email for 15 days.\n",
    "Translate the survey into the different languages of the country to make people feel comfortable and introduce a line that says that is anonymous.\n",
