    "No. I would not use a survey as it as difficult to get good quality data (secual orientation and use of condoms). At a very small scale and between buyers in a pharmacy, etc...I could use a private survey but not sure if it could get better\n",

    "It depends. I would use a survey for the design of the advertising campaign and to try especific things about it. I would not use ot to test the success rate of the campaign once launched. (size of the sample, other ways to get that data that are more effective: A/B testing)\n",
